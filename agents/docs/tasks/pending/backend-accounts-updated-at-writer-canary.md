# Pin the accounts.updated_at writer set with a canary

**Owner:** backend
**Created:** 2026-09-06

Routed out of the round-4 architect review of the custody-column alignment
work. The dependency this guards was created by that task; the guard is
separate work, so it is filed here rather than held there.

## Why

The `/link` stuck-recovery lookup in `routes/signup-verify.ts` admits a row
only when `upgraded_at <= updated_at`. That branch bypasses the signup
session-binding check, so the ordering is what keeps an upgraded self-custody
account out of a bypass it must never reach. The ordering holds for exactly one
reason: an upgrade stamps `upgraded_at` and never touches `updated_at`, so an
upgraded row always carries an epoch strictly newer than its recency marker.

That reason depends in turn on a universal the route comment states outright:
the two signup finalizes are the only statements that write
`accounts.updated_at`, and the table carries no trigger. The claim is true
today. Four independent checks during the round-4 review confirmed it (a grep
of every `UPDATE accounts` in `backend/src`, two reviewer enumerations, and a
validation pass), and no migration defines a trigger on `accounts`.

Nothing enforces it. A third writer added later for an unrelated reason (a
settings touch, a profile write, an admin tool) would bump `updated_at` on an
upgraded row, invert the ordering, and silently make that account eligible for
the binding bypass. No existing test goes red. The seven canaries already in
`tests/eslint/` are the established way this repo enforces tree-wide invariants
of exactly this shape.

## Scope

1. Add a source canary under `backend/tests/eslint/` that finds every statement
   in `backend/src` writing `accounts.updated_at` and asserts the writer set is
   exactly the two signup finalizes: the `/confirm` finalize and the `/link`
   finalize. An allow-list keyed on `file#symbol`, so a third writer fails the
   bar rather than passing silently. The `sourcesUnder` and
   `statementOccurrences` helpers in `tests/support/enclosing-symbol.ts` already
   do the scanning and symbol attribution; reuse them rather than writing a
   third walker.
2. The failure message must say why the set is closed, not just that it
   changed: name the `/link` stuck-recovery ordering and the session-binding
   bypass it protects, so whoever trips it can tell whether their new writer is
   safe. A bare "unexpected site" message sends the next author to delete the
   assertion.
3. Verify the guard by mutation, not by reasoning: add a third `updated_at`
   writer to a scratch copy of a route, confirm the canary reds, and confirm it
   greens again when removed.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The canary passes on the current tree with the allow-list naming exactly the
   two finalizes.
2. Adding any third `accounts.updated_at` writer to `backend/src` turns it red,
   demonstrated by mutation rather than asserted.
3. The failure message names the invariant at risk, not only the drift.

## Notes

- Known limit, worth stating in the canary's docblock rather than discovering
  later: the scan is textual, so a dynamically assembled `UPDATE` statement
  would hide from it. No `UPDATE accounts` SET list in `backend/src` is
  string-interpolated today, which is what makes a text scan sound here.
- Do not widen this into a general "audit every accounts column writer" guard.
  The value is specific to `updated_at`, because that column is the one a
  security-relevant ordering is measured against.
- The companion architect work (recording the ordering dependency in
  ARCHITECTURE.md § 6.1 / § 6.7) is deferred to the archive of the
  custody-column alignment task. This canary does not depend on it.
