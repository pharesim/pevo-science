# The assembled-write scan reads one head where the shared set names two

**Owner:** backend
**Created:** 2026-09-16

Routed out of the round-2 architect review of the ALTER `IF EXISTS` pin. Pre-existing
and untouched by that round, and a file-wide decision rather than an ALTER-arm one, so
it is filed here rather than held there.

## Why

`READ_FROM_HEADS` exists to be the single enumeration of every head a statement is read
FROM, and it names two patterns: `ACCOUNTS_STATEMENT_RE` and `ALTER_ACCOUNTS_RE`. Two
scan sites iterate it. Two others do not: `accountsColumnWriters` and `assembledWrites`
each walk `ACCOUNTS_STATEMENT_RE` alone.

For `assembledWrites` that is a silent pass in the direction the file cares about. An
ALTER against `accounts` whose column name is interpolated is not reported as an
assembled write, because the scan never sees the head. The file's own docblock argues
the opposite of this scoping, and the dynamic-SQL entry in KNOWN LIMITS leans on an
assignment backstop that the ALTER head does not have: an ALTER carries no assignment
token for another arm to resolve, so one dynamic identifier is enough to go quiet.

## Scope

1. Decide whether the two single-head sites should read from `READ_FROM_HEADS`. They are
   not obviously the same case: `assembledWrites` looks unintended, while
   `accountsColumnWriters` may be deliberately column-write-shaped. Say which is which
   from the code and its docblocks, not from this task file.
2. For whichever sites should widen, point them at the shared set, matching the two arms
   that already iterate it.
3. For whichever should not, record the narrowing where a reader will hit it — including
   a sentence in the dynamic-SQL KNOWN LIMITS entry saying its assignment-backstop
   reasoning does not extend to the ALTER head.
4. Check whether any OTHER consumer of a head pattern in this file spells its own walk
   instead of reading the shared enumeration, and report what the sweep covered from the
   code rather than asserting completeness.

## Acceptance criteria

1. An interpolated `ALTER TABLE accounts DROP COLUMN ${column}` planted in a `src` file
   is either reported as an assembled write, or its absence is recorded as a named limit
   with the reasoning that makes it acceptable. Demonstrated by planting, either way.
2. The clean tree stays green, and the allowed-alteration tally is unchanged.
3. If a site is widened, a fixture reds when it is pointed back at the single head, so
   the widening is pinned rather than asserted.

## Notes

Verified live at review time: an interpolated ALTER head planted in a `src` file leaves
the suite green, while the same text in a migration reds. The two `READ_FROM_HEADS`
iterations and the two single-head walks are all in this one file, so the blast radius
is the canary itself.
